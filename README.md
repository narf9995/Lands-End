I initially wrote this game based on the rules of Cribbage for my Tabletop Role Playing Game setting. Most of my favorite settings have had an in-world gambling game the players could use to kill time & make some quick, albeit risky cash. So I set out on the quest of making my own gambling game.

I love cribbage as my grandfather taught it to me. It's easily my favorite card game I've played, but could never get my friends to play a 61-point game. Nevermind a 121-point one & traditional multi-game "tournament" play was completely out the window. That's why I combined Reverse Cribbage with Nineteen & added some other rules to make play quicker. Honestly it turned out better than I expected it to. It's a very quick, cutthroat game that is great for betting. With the right mix of skill & luck, you could theoretically quadruple a bet in just one round of play. I already know it works well enough for my intentions, but I am wondering if the rules stand up to more competent/experienced card players.

I've played a few games with myself & enjoyed it, but have yet to get some friends together to playtest it. I'm not sure if this is the right place to share this, but I had enough fun that I thought other card players might enjoy this variation regardless of wether or not it's ultimately intended for an RPG setting. I also included some variations below, including the cribbage rules I based this document off of. They are originally from Scott McNeely's *Ultimate Book of Card Games*.

# LAND'S END
Scholars say it's a cultural variation.

Lawmen say it's illegal if untaxed.

Bar Keeps say it's an income & a liability.

Gamblers say it's a quick source of coin.

Poets say it's about mankind's destruction.

Minstrels sing about it's masters & exploits.

The Church says playing for money is a sin.

A theirmit once told me dragons created it...

You choose whose right.


## Overview
This is played almost exactly like a standard game of Cribbage. At the core, it's a combination of the existing variations: Reverse Cribbage & Nineteen. The major differences from the standard game is that the first player to score max points loses rather than wins & that maximum is decreased from 121 to 16. It's much harder than it sounds to not score points, especially if you’re the dealer. To make things more complicated, scoring no points in the scoring phase actually scores you 5 points, so you want to strike a balance & only score a little. If you are have 10 or less points when your opponent pegs out, then the established bet is doubled. If you are have 5 or less points when your opponent pegs out, then the bet is tripled. If your opponent manages to peg out before you can even score, then the bet is quadrupled.

Land's End requires skill, a healthy dose of strategy, and a pinch or two of luck—a heady brew that can sustain the interest of card players for hours on end. The game only takes a few hands to understand, but will take years to master. But don’t let this put you off. Land's End is a superb two-player game, but can be played with up to 4 players + "the house". The variants will be mentioned below.

One important element of the game is the board. Land's End boards are typically made of wood and have small pegs that simplify score tracking. A Land's End board is not required, but it makes scoring a lot easier. Use a Cribbage board if you have one, but anything with at least 2-3 lanes of 15 points would work for scoring.

If you have a folding Cribbage board then that's the ideal as this is what was originally used to play. There is no "16th Peg" when the board is folded, so the players "Falls of the End of the World" when they "Peg Out". This is the origin of the games name. Land's End is ultimately just a quicker, reversed, & much more cutthroat variation on Cribbage.

## HOW TO DEAL

Start with a standard fifty-two-card deck. Cards rank high to low from king down to ace. Face cards are all worth 10, aces are worth 1, and all other cards are worth their index value. Deal each player six cards, one at a time and face down. No other cards are dealt.

Each player looks at their cards and then nominates two cards to place face down in the center of the table. This is the "pocket", an extra hand of four cards that always belongs to the dealer. Once the pocket is established, the non-dealer cuts the deck, and the dealer turns up the top card from the lower portion of the deck. This is the turn-up card, which is used by both players as a fifth card in their hand. If the turn-up card is a jack, the dealer scores 1 point for their Heels (see “Scoring” below).

## SCORING

The goal in Land's End is to be the last player to score 16 points.

To make things more complicated, scoring 0 points in the showing/scoring phase actually scores you 5 points, so you want to strike a balance & only score a little.

If you are have 10 or less points when your opponent pegs out, then the established bet is doubled. If you are have 5 or less points when your opponent pegs out, then the bet is tripled. If your opponent manages to peg out before you can even score, then the bet is quadrupled.

In tournament play, each "game" is a series of games & your # of wins is multiplied rather than sum of the bet. Typically 2-out-of-3 or 3-out-of-5 series, although longer games such as 5-out-of-7, 7-out-of-10, or even more are possible.

Players earn points for scoring the following combinations:

### Fifteen

Score 2 points for any card combination that adds up to 15 points.

### Pair
Two cards of the same rank earn 2 points. In the matching phase, players earn points if they pair an opponent’s card. For example, if player one throws 9 of diamonds and player two throws 9 of clubs, player two earns 2 points for the pair.

### Multiple Pairs

Three cards of the same rank are worth 6 points, because they can be combined into three sets of pairs. For example, 4 of hearts, 4 of diamonds, 4 of clubs in your hand may be combined into three pairs of fours (4 of hearts-4 of diamonds, 4 of hearts-4 of clubs, 4 of diamonds-4 of clubs) for a total of 6 points. With four cards of the same rank, you earn 12 total points for making six sets of pairs. Multiple pairs also may be played in the matching phase. For example, player one throws 5 of hearts and player two throws 5 of clubs for 2 points. If player one replies with 5 of diamonds, they earns 6 points for three sets of pairs (5 of hearts-5 of clubs, 5 of hearts-5 of diamonds, 5 of clubs-5 of diamonds). If player two miraculously follows with a fourth card of the same rank, they earn 12 points.

### Run

At minimum, a run is three cards in sequence, regardless of suit. So 5 of hearts-6 of diamonds-7 of diamonds earns a player 3 points, while a run of four cards is worth 4 points. If a player has a pair of cards in the run, multiple runs may be scored. For example, the hand 3 of hearts-4 of diamonds-5 of hearts-5 of clubs is worth 8 total points for the two three-card runs (3 of hearts-4 of diamonds-5 of hearts for 3 points; 3 of hearts-4 of diamonds-5 of clubs for 3 points), plus a pair of fives for 2 additional points. A quadruple run (for example, 9-9-10-10-J) scores 16 points.

In the matching phase, players earn points for runs even if the cards are not played sequentially. For example, if player one throws 5 of clubs and player two throws 7 of hearts, then player one may throw any 6 to earn 3 points for a run. The run is not allowed if a nonsequential card is thrown into the mix. So in this example, the run is not scored if the cards are played in the following order: 5 of clubs, 7 of hearts, J of diamonds, 6 of clubs.

### Flush

At minimum, a flush is four cards of the same suit, regardless of rank. So the hand 3 of hearts-7 of hearts-10 of hearts-J of hearts is worth 4 points (1 point for each card in the flush). If the turn-up card is also a heart, the hand is worth 5 points. Flushes are earned only for cards held in your own hand. Flushes may not be earned during the matching phase, and four-card flushes in the pocket do not earn any points. However, if the pocket cards are of the same suit and if the turn-up card matches that suit, then the pocket owner earns 5 points for a pocket flush.

### their Nobs

This oddly named bonus (worth 1 point) is earned by any player who holds a jack of the same suit as the turn-up card.

### their Heels

Another oddly named bonus (1 point), this time earned by the dealer when they happens to turn up a jack.

### Go Point

A player pegs 1 “go” point when their opponent cannot play a card without taking the total over 31 points; or 2 “go” points for himself when they scores exactly 31 points and forces their opponent to begin play back at zero.


### Last Point

The player who throws the last card in the matching phase earns 1 point.

## HOW TO PLAY

Each hand of Land's End is divided into two phases, the matching phase and the showing phase. Points scored during the matching phase count for your opponent. Points scored during the showing phase count for yourself.

### Matching Phase

Once the pocket is established and the turn-up card is settled, the game starts with the non-dealer leading a single card from their hand, face up, and announcing the card’s rank out loud (for example, if you play 5 of hearts, announce “five”). Players then alternate throwing cards face up on the table, in an attempt to earn points by combining their cards plus their opponent’s into pairs, runs, fifteens, and “go” points.

For example, if player one throws 7 of diamonds and player two throws 7 of hearts, player two pegs 2 points for a pair. If player one replies with 7 of spades, they pegs 6 total points for creating three sets of pairs.

Alternatively, if no pairs, runs, or fifteens are scored, then the player who cannot play a card without going over 31 total points sacrifices a “go” point to their opponent. For example, if player one leads 10 of hearts, player two follows with Q of spades, and player one replies with 8 of diamonds, then player two either must throw a three (thereby pegging 2 points for hitting 31 exactly); or throw an ace or a two, keeping the total below 31 points; or, if they cannot play a card without exceeding 31 points, peg 1 “go” point to their opponent. In the latter case, the count begins again at zero and the next card is led by player one.

The player who throws the last card in the matching phase scores 1 point.

### Showing Phase

Once each player has exhausted their four cards, each “shows” and scores their cards in the following strict order: non-dealer, dealer, dealer’s pocket.

The turn-up card is used by both players as a fifth card in their hands.

### Scoring The Pocket

After the matching and showing phases are finished, the dealer turns up the pocket cards and pegs points for any pairs, multiple pairs, runs, flushes, and fifteens it contains, using the turn-up card as a fifth card in the hand.

## HOW TO WIN

There are two critical decisions a player must make in Land's End: which two cards to throw into the pocket, and which card to lead with in the matching phase.

The pocket decision is usually straightforward if you’re the dealer. Look at your six cards and determine which four have the worst odds of earning points for pairs and runs. As the dealer, you will earn any points in the pocket, so avoid putting points in it if possible. When in doubt, split up your 5s, face cards, & pairs/runs. You can't get rid of cards as dealer, so this is about minimizing your score by playing the hand as "poorly" as possible.

The decision is slightly more complicated for the non-dealer. You must strike a balance between keeping as few points as possible in your hand while also trying throw as many points as possible into the dealer’s pocket. When in doubt, never keep a 5 or a face card & never keep pair or runs. These are the cards you put in your opponent's pocket.

## POINTS OF ETIQUETTE

Etiquette matters in Land's End. Even through this is a game of treachery, we must maintain some common courtesy. There are not many rules, so novice players owe it to themselves to commit the following to memory. If you don't, you're liable to start a fight.

After playing a card, always announce the current card total. It is rude to do otherwise. For example, if you throw 8 of diamonds on 10 of hearts, say “eighteen.”

Similarly, announce what you’re scoring as you play. If you throw 5 of diamonds on J of hearts, say “fifteen for 2 points.” If you throw 9 of clubs on 7 of diamonds-8 of hearts, say “24 for a run of three.”

Table talk is not allowed in Land's End. So do not discuss or drop hints about cards you hold, cards in the pocket, points of strategy, etc.

If a player forgets to peg a score they are entitled to, or simply doesn’t add their points properly, once the next card is played, the opponent may declare "muggins" and force the player to score double the total sum of their unearned points.

## VARIATIONS

### Casino Play
Casino play is done using the Three-hand Land's End or Four-hand Land's End variations. The house always deals, although in Three-hand Casino the pocket still rotates. Play is either clockwise or counterclockwise. Play starts with the player to the left (if play is clockwise) or to the right (if play is counterclockwise). The direction of play is decided by coin-flip, dice-roll, or by drawing cards to see who gets the highest card (Aces low, faces ranked 11-13). The method used to determine this doesn't matter as long as it has equal odds. Winner picks direction of play. House should always get the pocket last no matter the direction of play.

In Three-hand Casino the house is the third player & uses the middle track to score on the board. In Four-hand Casino the house still scores on the middle track, but uses the pocket as their hand. The other major difference with Four-hand Casino is that the house wins when they peg out by scoring 16+ points instead of losing like the players.

In the matching phase, the only difference is that in the case of a go point being earned, the next round is always opened by the first player unable to play a card in the previous round. The player to the left (if play is clockwise) or to the right (if play is counterclockwise) of the dealer determines the turn-up card, and also opens. When scoring during the showing phase, the order is always the same direction as decided at the beginning of the game.

The rarer form of casino play uses the two-hand traditional version. The only difference is that the house always deals & the player always scores the pocket. There is no rotation of the pocket.

### Variation 1: Cribbage
#### HOW TO DEAL
Start with a standard fifty-two-card deck. Cards rank high to low from king down to ace. Face cards are worth 10 points, aces are worth 1, and all other cards are worth their index value. Deal each player six cards, one at a time and face down. No other cards are dealt.

Each player looks at their cards and then nominates two cards to place face down in the center of the table. This is the crib, an extra hand of four cards that always belongs to the dealer. Once the crib is established, the non-dealer cuts the deck, and the dealer turns up the top card from the lower portion of the deck. This is the turn-up card, which is used by both players as a fifth card in their hand. If the turn-up card is a jack, the dealer scores 1 point for their Heels (see “Scoring” below).

#### SCORING
The goal in Cribbage is to be the first player to score 121 points (in tournament play, if a player wins with 121 points before their opponent scores 61 points, a double-game score is earned). Players earn points for scoring the following combinations:


#### HOW TO PLAY
Each hand of Cribbage is divided into two phases, the matching phase and the showing phase.


##### Matching Phase
Once the crib is established and the turn-up card is settled, the game starts with the non-dealer leading a single card from their hand, face up, and announcing the card’s rank out loud (for example, if you play 5 of hearts, announce “five”). Players then alternate throwing cards face up on the table, in an attempt to earn points by combining their cards plus their opponent’s into pairs, runs, fifteens, and “go” points.
For example, if player one throws 7 of diamonds and player two throws 7 of hearts, player two pegs 2 points for a pair. If player one replies with 7 of spades, they pegs 6 total points for creating three sets of pairs.

Alternatively, if no pairs, runs, or fifteens are scored, then the player who cannot play a card without going over 31 total points sacrifices a “go” point to their opponent. For example, if player one leads 10 of hearts, player two follows with Q of spades, and player one replies with 8 of diamonds, then player two either must throw a three (thereby pegging 2 points for hitting 31 exactly); or throw an ace or a two, keeping the total below 31 points; or, if they cannot play a card without exceeding 31 points, peg 1 “go” point to their opponent. In the latter case, the count begins again at zero and the next card is led by player one.
The player who throws the last card in the matching phase scores 1 point.

##### Showing Phase
Once each player has exhausted their four cards, each “shows” and scores their cards in the following strict order: non-dealer, dealer, dealer’s crib.

The turn-up card is used by both players as a fifth card in their hands.

##### Scoring The Crib
After the matching and showing phases are finished, the dealer turns up the crib cards and pegs points for any pairs, multiple pairs, runs, flushes, and fifteens it contains, using the turn-up card as a fifth card in the hand.

#### HOW TO WIN
There are two critical decisions a player must make in Cribbage: which two cards to throw into the crib, and which card to lead with in the matching phase. The crib decision is usually straightforward if you’re the dealer. Look at your six cards and determine which four have the best odds of earning points for pairs and runs. As the dealer, you ultimately will earn any points in the crib, so it’s OK to throw a pair into the crib if it means you keep a run of three or more together in your hand. When in doubt, keep a run, and hope the turn-up card will add to it.

The decision is more complicated for the non-dealer. You must strike a balance between keeping the best four cards possible in your hand and being careful not to throw useful point cards into the dealer’s crib.

There’s no more frustrating hand to be dealt when you’re the non-dealer than 3 of hearts-3 of diamonds-5 of hearts-5 of diamonds-6 of hearts-7 of spades. You hate to throw any points into the dealer’s crib. Yet there’s no other choice, so minimize the pain by throwing 3 of hearts-3 of diamonds into the crib (a gift of 2 points to the dealer) and keep the other four cards, since they have a much greater scoring potential.

#### POINTS OF ETIQUETTE

If a player forgets to peg a score they is entitled to, or simply doesn’t add their points properly, once the next card is played, the opponent may declare muggins and take the unearned points as their own.

### Variation 2: Reverse Cribbage
This is played exactly like the Cribbage variation, the only difference is that the first player to score 121 points loses rather than wins just like in Land's End. This is a superb variation for veteran Cribbage players who love the basic game, but are looking for new challenges.

### Variation 3: Three-hand Land's End
This is an excellent game for three players and requires no extra learning or effort, as long as you’re already familiar with the basic two-hand game. The game is played exactly like the standard game, with the following exceptions.

Instead of four cards, all players are dealt five, and one card is dealt to the pocket. Each player then throws one card into the pocket, so each player (as well as the pocket) holds four cards.

In the matching phase, the only difference is that in the case of a go point being earned, the next round is always opened by the first player unable to play a card in the previous round. The player to the left of the dealer determines the turn-up card, and also opens. When scoring during the showing phase, the order is always clockwise, starting with the player to the left of the dealer.

### Variation 4: Four-hand Land's End
The main argument against four-hand cribbage is that few opportunities exist to work collaboratively with your partner. There is no bidding, no trump, no dummy hand—none of the features common to more sophisticated four-player partnership games.

The game is played exactly like the standard two-hand game, except that partners sit opposite one another, and instead of four cards, all players are dealt five. Each player then throws one card into the pocket, so all players (plus the pocket) have four cards.

The player to the left of the dealer determines the turn-up card and leads the first round. In the case of a go point being scored, the first player unable to play a card in the previous round always leads the next round. Each team combines its score during the game. When scoring during the showing phase, the order is always non-dealing team, dealing team, dealing team’s pocket.

### Variation 5: Tabletop Land's End
This is a no-peekie offshoot of Land's End (think of it as standard Land's End minus the matching phase) and uses most of the same scoring rules. The game is best for two players sitting side-by-side (not across from each other). Deal twelve cards to each player, face down in a pile, and do not look at any cards. Take the next card and lay it face up in the middle of the table. Put a marker (penny, beer cap, matchstick, etc.) on top of it. No other cards are dealt.
Tabletop Land's End uses a five-by-five layout of cards. The object is to play point-earning cards in rows (if you’re the non-dealer) or columns (if you’re the dealer). The non-dealer leads, and plays a card in any empty slot. The only restriction is that the card must touch the edge of an existing card on the board, either to the side, top or bottom, or diagonal edge.

![Tabletop Land's End Diagram](/data/images/tabletop_cribbage.png)

Each player alternates taking a card from their hand (remember, players are not allowed to look at their cards) and playing it on the board. No points are scored until all twenty-four cards have been played. The non-dealer always counts points first. Each row or column is treated like a standard hand of Land's End, scoring points for pairs, runs, and/or fifteens. Only five-card flushes are allowed. No points are awarded for their Heels or their Nobs.
